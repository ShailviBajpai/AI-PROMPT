// The "models" object is provided by the Mongoose Library and stores all the registered models.
//  If a model named "User" already exists in the "models" object, it assigns that existing model to the "User" variable.
//  This prevents redefining the model and ensures that the existing model is reused.
//  If a model named "User' does not exist in the "models" object, the "model" function from Mongoose is called to create a new model
// The newly created model is then assigned to the "User" variable.
